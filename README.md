Here are the examples of:

1. classification with MLP neural network where the model was trained and evaluated, and then the classification prediction was shown. Correction was also performed using different optimizers (in this case ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation), SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) and LBFGS (Limited Memory BFGS)).
 
2. training of RNN neural network in terms of regression and prediction models for the selected data set. Different combinations of parameters were analyzed.
